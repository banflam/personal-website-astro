Updated Friday afternoon, November 7 2025 from Austin, Texas.

Living in Austin and working at Visa (the card payment company) as a Software Engineer (SWE).

That's my official job title, but what I do (and what everybody else on the team is called) is actually entirely being a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). 

Job, apartment, car -- the whole nine yards.
