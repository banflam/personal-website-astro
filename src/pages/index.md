# My quest for AWS

_How I achieved the AWS Certified Developer Associate certification -- and the lessons I learned along the way_

## Why this article

It's been a long and arduous road towards that lead to last weekend, when I finally went down to the Pearson testing center and took the [AWS DVA-C02 Certified Developer Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/a5534cca-8dc8-47d8-b7c9-0359077ba0b5/public_url) exam...and passed! Finally, it was done! I considered the time it took, the struggle, the self-doubt and the eventual triumph and realized that it might be helpful if other people might be able to learn from my experience. That's why I decided to write this article sharing my journey and the lessons I learned along the way.

And also, being blessed to be in the tech field, I have gained from the generosity of all those who have gone before me and shared what they have learned, making the path ahead just that much clearer. It might just be that I have a ["duty to document"](https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/duty-to-document) like those who went before me, so here it goes.

## Why AWS?

I was rapidly running out of runway back at the University of Maryland; it would soon be time to graduate. What to do? What could I do to make myself more employable and get some additional real-world skills? Admittedly, I was also hooked on the idea of learning some more stuff and learning a couple additional useful things.

Well, I did a bit of digging around online and found out that pretty much the only kinds of certifications that add any sort of value are those from Amazon Web Services.
